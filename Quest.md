# Overall Thought

Build an epic style quest that people need to discover. The quest will be challenging in both getting rare loot drops and in the encounters. The goal to this quest is to make it accessible to any one who meets the minimum requirements.

## Core Idea

The idea…. Is that there is a piece of loot OR someone you must talk to In every zone…. This forces the player to visit all of Norrath….We can add these custom items to the loot tables on some of these NPCs…

The reason why I want it like this, is because some people have never been to some zones….. and some have a hard time exploring some of the zones… I think it would be a fun and rewarding way to force exploration. The Reward is continual… So while the first Fragment might not be amazing… it is still rewarding on its own.

- Minimum level to start the quest : 50 - level locked at each stage
- Payments - Various amount of AA as payment along the way.
- Reward - An “Epic Augment” Similar to the Zeb weapon, this augment is designed to be a main hand augment, and depending on which version you use changes the base stats. You change the version by turning it into an NPC in the Bazaar and he returns the next one. This way you do not have to use an effect on the item.

Once you complete the quest… or each segment of the quest you cannot go back and do it again.
Stats at Aporia and Catas determination.

> Note: All NPC encounters to be custom made in custom zone instances, and pose a different set of challenges designed for various class types.I will try to explain my thought process for each zone.

## Premise

Long before the gods shaped the Planes, before Veeshan scarred Norrath, the Nameless left behind an Echo of itself ,a void-being that fed on silence and entropy. The gods struck it down and bound it with five great Seals, hidden across Norrath, Kunark, Velious, Luclin, and the Planes. But the seals are breaking. Shadows stir in forgotten corners. Mortals dream of silence. Old foes seek fragments of power. The player becomes the “Echo Bearer”, chosen to hunt the fragments, defeat the corrupted, and either reforge the Seal or see the world consumed by silence.

- Every zone has something (loot, ground pick-up, clicky item, or NPC interaction).
- Mix of direct instructions and cryptic hints (so some steps are obvious, others misleading or vague).

## Structure of the Quest

This quest will send players across every expansion, level locked and require payment of AA to proceed at certain point to prevent speed runs. The quest will use old and new lore. The player will hunt down fragments of the Shattered Seal, each tied to a realm, a god, or a forgotten villain and do so before the Nameless Echo can return to Norrath.

## The Shattered Seal

### Act 1 - Whispers in the World (Classic)

Any player level 50 and above when they log in will see the following system message until they visit “The Dreaming Oracle” in West Freeport near the wall away from anyone normally walking by.

> <span style="color:#d97706">“Mortal, the night has been torn asunder. A seal, older than the gods, cracks in silence. I see fragments scattered across the lands, calling to warlords, kings, and shadows alike. You must be the one to bind them once more…lest the world unravel. Find me”</span>

### The Dreaming Oracle

- Location: West Freeport, western wall, away from traffic.
- Appearance: Hooded faceless (maybe Luclin model but smaller?)

> <span style="color:#15803d">“Hail The Dreaming Oracle.”</span>
> <span style="color:#1d4ed8">“Ah… so the echo has found its bearer. I am the Dreaming Oracle, keeper of visions that even the gods have forgotten. You have heard the call, yes? The Seal has whispered to you.”</span>
>
> <span style="color:#15803d">“What is this seal you speak of?”</span>
>
> <span style="color:#1d4ed8">“The Seal of the Echo was forged before time itself… older than Solusek’s fire, older than Innoruuk’s hate. It bound away something that should never be named. Now, it is shattered into fragments, splintered by greed, by blood, by dreams.”</span>
>
> <span style="color:#15803d">“What fragments?”</span>
>
> <span style="color:#1d4ed8">“The shards lie hidden… across mountains and tombs, under roots and waves, in the grip of tyrants and fools alike. No map can guide you—only whispers, and perhaps the marks I leave for you.”</span>

#### Oracle Gives Quest Item:

- Item: Satchel of Echoes
- Description: “A faint hum resonates from within. It seems to long for fragments lost across the lands.”
- Slots: 20
- Function: Holds Act 1 items

> ##### <span style="color:#7e22ce">(Player Flag)</span>
>
> <span style="color:#1d4ed8">“Take this satchel, Bearer of Echos. Its pockets will hold what you find—fragments, clues, and whispers. Each item placed here is part of the Seal’s song. When the satchel stirs fully, you will know to return to me.”</span>
>
> <span style="color:#15803d">“Hail The Dreaming Oracle.”</span>
> <span style="color:#1d4ed8">“Ah… the Bearer of Echos returns. You have felt the whispers already. Do you sense their pull in forests, mountains, and tombs? The fragments stir, and some will seek to mislead you.”</span>
>
> <span style="color:#15803d">“How will I know what fragments are real?”</span>
> <span style="color:#1d4ed8">“The fragments are marked by resonance—faint hums only a keen ear can sense. Some will call to your hands, some to your mind. Watch for the marks I leave, and heed the whispers that align with the Seal. Your satchel will stir when you hold them all.”</span>
>
> <span style="color:#15803d">“Where do I begin?”</span>
> <span style="color:#1d4ed8">“The first echo lies in lands familiar yet twisted by greed. Seek the gnolls who hoard what they should not. The first is only a taste—the rest will call you deeper into Norrath.”</span>
